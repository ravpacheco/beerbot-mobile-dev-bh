# random-words
> A bot that maybe will answer you with a random english word

This example demonstrates the use of the `messaginghub-client-js` library to build a simple bot which runs on the [MessagingHub](http://omni.messaginghub.io) platform.

## How to run
In order to run this example, run the following commands on a terminal, which will install the package dependencies for this sample and run the `index.js` file:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

After this example bot is setup and running, you can try it by sending any message to `randomwords@msging.net` via any channel currently supported by MessagingHub (SMS, Omni, Facebook, Telegram or Skype).
